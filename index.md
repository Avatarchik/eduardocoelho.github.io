### About

![](/images/profile_picture.jpg)

My name is Eduardo Coelho, I am graduated in Computer Science and I am a software engineer mainly interested in mobile application development. I am an optimist startup enthusiast and some of my interests include technology, architecture, design, traveling, cafés and dogs.

I started developing native iOS applications in 2008, I also worked with Xamarin cross-platform applications in 2012. I currently develop casual games with Unity3D for iOS and Android platforms.

I’m enjoying life at my home office in Apiúna, SC (Brazil), from where I work as a remote developer since 2013. I value work ethic and flexibility and I’m always on the lookout for interesting new things to learn.
