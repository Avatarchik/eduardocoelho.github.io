I decided to create a [Blog](/blog/) page on my developer website so that I can keep track of new things I bump into my professional (and maybe personal) life. I think it would worth sharing some stuff with the community.

Since I just started using Jekyll it was a bit tricky for me to get blog posts (and pagination) working on a separated page, thankfully guys at pixyll commented on my [issue](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll/issues/164#issuecomment-104403807) very quickly and got my problem solved.
