I decided to create a [Blog](/blog/) page on my personal website so that I can keep track of new things I bump into in my professional (and maybe personal) life. It think it would worth sharing some stuff with the community.

Since I just started using Jekyll it was a bit tricky to get my blog posts (and pagination) working on a separated page, hopefully guys at [pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll/issues/164#issuecomment-104403807) were very helpful and  helped me rightaway.
